## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python run.py`

### Switching to New Architecture

The new modular architecture can be used by running:

```
python run.py --debug
```

The legacy version can still be run with:

```
python app.py
```

## Upgrading from Previous Version

If you're upgrading from an earlier version:

1. Back up your database:
```
python run.py --backup-db
```

2. Run the upgrade script:
```
python upgrade_db.py
```

3. For detailed instructions, see the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Testing

Run the system test script to verify all components:

```
python system_test.py
```

This will check:
- Database connections and schema
- Model classes functionality
- Route modules registration
- Template and static file presence
