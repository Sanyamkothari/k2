### 🧪 Testing Guide

#### 1. Local Development Testing

```bash
# Test in development mode first
python app.py

# Verify all endpoints are working
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:5000/
```

#### 2. Docker Testing

```bash
# Build and test Docker containers
docker-compose up --build

# Test container health
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs

# Test database connection
docker-compose exec db psql -U hostel_user -d hostel_db -c "\dt"

# Test Redis connection
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

#### 3. Socket.IO Testing

```bash
# Access Socket.IO test page
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000/socketio-test

# Test real-time features:
# 1. Connect to Socket.IO
# 2. Send test notifications
# 3. Test broadcast messages
# 4. Verify connection counts
# 5. Test reconnection handling
```

#### 4. Security Testing

```bash
# Test SSL configuration
openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com

# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Test HTTP to HTTPS redirect
curl -I http://your-domain.com
```

#### 5. Performance Testing

```bash
# Basic load testing with curl
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:5000/
done

# Memory usage monitoring
docker stats

# Database performance
docker-compose exec db psql -U hostel_user -d hostel_db -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```

#### 6. Backup Testing

```bash
# Test database backup
./backup-hostel-db.sh

# Test backup restoration
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U hostel_user hostel_db > backup.sql
docker-compose exec db psql -U hostel_user -d hostel_db_test < backup.sql
```

### 🔧 Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hostel_management_v2

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit environment variables
nano .env
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Required variables in .env:
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hostel_user:secure_password@db:5432/hostel_db
REDIS_URL=redis://:redis_password@redis:6379/0
DOMAIN=your-domain.com
EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Application

```bash
# For Linux/Unix systems
chmod +x deploy-production.sh
sudo ./deploy-production.sh

# For Windows systems
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy-production.ps1 -Action deploy
```

#### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Test application health
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check database container
docker-compose logs db

# Test connection manually
docker-compose exec db psql -U hostel_user -d hostel_db

# Reset database if needed
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

**2. Redis Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check Redis container
docker-compose logs redis

# Test Redis connection
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping

# Check authentication
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli -a your_redis_password ping
```

**3. SSL Certificate Issues**
```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem -text -noout

# Regenerate self-signed certificate
./deploy-production.sh ssl-only

# For Let's Encrypt issues
certbot certificates
certbot renew --dry-run
```

**4. Socket.IO Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check if WebSocket connections are allowed
# Verify firewall settings
# Check proxy configuration for WebSocket support

# Test Socket.IO directly
curl -k https://your-domain.com/socket.io/
```

**5. Performance Issues**
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Check database performance
docker-compose exec db psql -U hostel_user -d hostel_db -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Optimize database if needed
docker-compose exec db psql -U hostel_user -d hostel_db -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"
```

### 📞 Emergency Procedures

#### Application Down
1. Check Docker container status: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Restart services: `docker-compose restart`
4. If persistent, restore from backup

#### Database Issues
1. Check database container: `docker-compose logs db`
2. Test connection: `docker-compose exec db pg_isready`
3. If corrupted, restore from latest backup
4. Contact database administrator if needed

#### Security Breach
1. Immediately isolate affected systems
2. Change all passwords and API keys
3. Review access logs
4. Restore from clean backup if needed
5. Implement additional security measures
